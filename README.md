# mkdd_rename_release_files
 A script for renaming mkdd track release files to fit with Yoshi2's mkdd .iso patcher 

Put the .bat and the .py file in the same directory as mkdd track release files.
The release files should have the same name as the in-game files.
#For example, if your track is replacing Peach Beach, then:
#-Your track .arc file should be named "Peach.arc"
#-Your course name files should be named "coname_peach_beach.bti"
#-Your regular speed course audio should be named "COURSE_CIRCUIT_0.x.32.c4.ast"
#and so on.
